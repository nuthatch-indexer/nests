# nuthatch nests — the index

The catalogue of prebuilt **nests** for [Nuthatch](https://github.com/nuthatch-indexer/nuthatch) — packaged indexing definitions (ABIs + decoded event tables + declarative views) that replace a rented subgraph with a self-hosted one.

A nest is consumed with `nuthatch init --from <repo-url>`, or generated straight from a contract address with `nuthatch init 0xAddr`. This repo is the human- and machine-readable **index** ([`index.json`](index.json)) — the single source of truth the website builds from. Each nest lives in its own repo on this org.

- **Live catalogue page:** https://nuthatch-indexer.com/nests
- **Demand-ranked reasoning:** [`docs/nest-catalogue.md`](https://github.com/nuthatch-indexer/nuthatch/blob/main/docs/nest-catalogue.md) in the core repo

## Status

- 🟢 **available** — installable today, from a published repo or a contract address.
- 🟡 **building** — running in the wild, being packaged into a published nest here.
- ⚪ **planned** — on the catalogue, demand-ranked; not built yet. No fake install commands.

## Publishing a nest

A nest is self-contained — `nuthatch.toml`, vendored `abis/`, and its `views/` / `checks/`. Publishing one is a `git push` of its repo to this org; then add it to `index.json` (the site and this README follow). See [`horizon-nest`](https://github.com/nuthatch-indexer/horizon-nest) for the shape.
